>I recently finished the first part  of my tertiary schooling(most
people end their formal schooling at this stage) and will soon be
an undergraduate citizen of the world,obviously you can only be a
citizen of a particular piece of land on earth but with some money
,time and energy you can approximate global citizenship (relative to bank account
depth) of earth as per the current rules .Dreams aside now
starts the ritualistic struggle of working ones way to such 
freedoms. Most human inhabited pieces of land have some form of human
laws by which the human constituents are to abide by,the exact
structure and creation of these laws is dependent on the permanent
inhabitants of the piece of land in question but these laws are to be
a representation of the spirit, fears and desires of the subjects ,and how
they will interact with each other. Most early civilisations  just
left this task to a small set  of spiritual leaders and a cohort of
people who had "special" blood that was said to make their generation and
lineage more fit to rule. This system is decisive about who was in
charge and most people could not jump from one rung in the social
ladder to the next but as we all know the intoxicating powers of
highly concentrated power. Modern times are said to be different vis a vis
republics and the democratic values said to spring from them appear to
be a better alternative social structure though their failure to bear
fruit  in africa is something that has been bothering me so dearly as I embark on my
adulthood.

>Africans as human beings have had a tough
couple of centuries compounded by the fact that most of our history
the past milenium is mostly made up of folk lore and accounts written
by the missionaries and explorers that made it to our part  of
earth. Africa is a big continent with a lot to offer as far as
diversity and natural wealth is concerned but to most of the other
inhabitants of this blue rock its a whole continent filled with the
extremes of human misery and ills of the human condition.Corruption
and poor governance are the de facto motto of most of the countries on
this continent of ours ,suffering and pain is taken as ennobling feature of
African life. The current desire for economic prosperity has left us
blind to other aspects of modern life that I believe need to be
addressed as Africa grows population wise and economically.
As an African youth it baffles me as to why
majority of the continent is plagued by similar ills some clearly
worse off than others but none the less the same underlying layers of
pain and struggle for a decent modern life.The lack of an actual
philosophical stand point in Africa is something to note 

>At this point in a human's life one is expected to have a professional
level of understanding of the subject that he carries an undergraduate
certificate level in .I would like to believe Software Engineering is an
always ongoing endeavour on perfecting ones craft like an artisan and
like art you need inspiration from a variety of fields mostly the
creative ones but as the recent years have demonstrated computers are
invading more aspects of our daily lives .of us reach this point and realise its never as clear cut as was potrayed . The future is always murky and most people justifiably use the past to predict future events and some others   
 Like most of my fellow Africans I grew up in a small community a town called Kireka and most of my neighbours knew each other or of each other, most of us have grown up as a community but as time strecthes we are now mostly chasing dreams or something akin to that.
